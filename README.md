# Practice: Creating a Webpage using the basics of HTML focusing on Semantic HTML Elements

### Practice understanding the Figures and Captioning Figures of a webpage

-   [ ] Simple practice to gain a better understanding of the purpose of the &lt;figure&gt; elelment and the &lt;figcaption&gt; element, along with what each entails
    -   [ ] Most sites have semantic elements that focus on images
    -   [ ] The &lt;figure&gt; element is the first to cover this and the &lt;figcaption&gt; element is used to add a caption to these figures.

-   [ ] The &lt;header&gt; element:
    -   [ ] Always goes in the &lt;body&gt; element
    -   [ ] It usually contains a header element: &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;
    -   [ ] The &lt;header&gt; elelment is not the same as the &lt;head&gt; element outside of the &lt;body&gt; element

-   [ ] The &lt;nav&gt; element:
    -   [ ] this element tends to containt ordered lists, unordered lists, or even the both types of lists
    -   [ ] These lists typically entails link with the #id-name of the desired section or part of the page would be in the "href" attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element for a list item
        -   [ ] &lt;a href="#about-section"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
            -   [ ] <a href="#about-section">About</a>
            -   [ ] When the user would click the About link they would then be directed to the About section of the page

-   [ ] The &lt;main&gt; element:
    -   [ ] This element usually follows the &lt;header&gt; element
    -   [ ] This element contains the main information of the webpage

-   [ ] The &lt;section&gt; element:
    -   [ ] This is used to group similar information together
    -   [ ] It is common to have a header element, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, as the first child of the &lt;section&gt; element
        -   [ ] This will help explain what each section will be about
    -   [ ] Unlike the &lt;main&gt; element that can only have one &lt;main&gt; elemennt on the webpage. There can be multiple &lt;section&gt; elements on the webpage

-   [ ] The &lt;article&gt; element:
    -   [ ] This will be within the &lt;section&gt; element and house a singular piece of content describing what the section is about in detail
    -   [ ] It is common to have a header to emphasis what each &lt;article&gt; element will be about.
    -   [ ] Then a &lt;p&gt; element that will discuss in detail what the &lt;article&gt; is about in great detail

-   [ ] The &lt;figure&gt; element:
    -   [ ] This would usually be within the &lt;article&gt; element
    -   [ ] It is used for graphics, images, or even a diagram

-   [ ] The &lt;figcaption&gt; element:
    -   [ ] This element is used to add captions or supportive text to the figures on the webpage

-   [ ] The &lt;footer&gt; element:
    -   [ ] this element tends to finish off the webpage as it is located at the very bottom of the webpage and last items that will be seen
    -   [ ] For instance:
        -   [ ] A copyright symbol for copyright information
        -   [ ] A link to external sources using the "href" attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element for the links in the list item to external sources
            -   [ ] &lt;a href="/privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;
                -   [ ] use the target attribute tp open the link path in a new tab instead of the current page
                -   [ ] <a href="/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy</a>
                -   [ ] When the user would click one of these external links they would be redirected to a new page with the information

---

- [ ] Encompass:
  - [ ] HTML
  - [ ] CSS
- [ ] HTML -> will be the structure and skeleton of how the app will appear on the webpage
- [ ] CSS -> encompass the style of the app and give it some flare
